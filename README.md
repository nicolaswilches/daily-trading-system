A quantitative trading pipeline that forecasts next-day stock price direction and magnitude for major US equities. Combines two LightGBM models (classification + regression) with a live Streamlit dashboard for real-time signal generation and strategy backtesting.

---

## Overview

The system is structured as two cooperating modules:

1. **Offline Pipeline:** Ingests 5 years of historical OHLCV and corporate fundamentals from SimFin, engineers 70+ features with Polars, and trains two LightGBM models optimized via Optuna Bayesian search.
2. **Live Dashboard:** A Streamlit application that fetches real-time data, runs inference, displays trading signals, and simulates historical strategy performance against a buy-and-hold benchmark.

**Core stack:** Polars, scikit-learn, Optuna, Streamlit, SimFin API

## Quick Start

**Prerequisites:** Python 3.12+, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), and a [SimFin API key](https://simfin.com/).

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nicolaswilches/daily-trading-system.git
cd daily-trading-system

# 2. Configure environment — create a .env file with your SimFin API key
echo "SIMFIN_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# 3. Install dependencies
uv sync
```

---

## Running the Pipeline

Run each step in order to reproduce the full pipeline from raw data to trained models.

```bash
# Step 1 — Ingest data from SimFin API (downloads ~5 years of prices + fundamentals)
uv run src/fetch_data.py

# Step 2 — Engineer features (point-in-time joins, technical indicators, fundamentals)
uv run src/etl.py

# Step 3 — Train and optimize both models via Optuna Bayesian search
uv run src/train.py
```

Pre-trained models are already included in `models/` — steps 1–3 are only needed to retrain.

---

## Running the Dashboard

```bash
uv run streamlit run main.py
```

The app will open at `http://localhost:8501`. Four pages are available:

| Page | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Home | Project overview and feature summary |
| Market Analysis | Live trading signals for selected tickers |
| Trading Strategy | Interactive backtesting with configurable parameters |
| Methodology | Model validation metrics and feature importance |

---

## Feature Engineering

The ETL pipeline generates 70+ features from daily price data and quarterly fundamentals:

| Category | Features |
| --- | --- |
| **Trend** | Distance from SMA-20, SMA-50, SMA-200 |
| **Momentum** | RSI proxy, 1-day log return |
| **Volatility** | Bollinger Band width (20-day rolling std), ATR-14 |
| **Fundamentals** | Return on Assets (ROA), Net Margin |

**Anti-leakage design:** fundamentals are aligned to prices using point-in-time joins (no future data seen during training). Validation uses 5-fold `TimeSeriesSplit` to respect temporal ordering.

---

## Model Architecture

Two LightGBM models are trained independently, each tuned with 30 Optuna trials:

| Model | Objective | Metric | Output |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Classifier** | Binary up/down direction | Precision (minimize false buys) | `prob_up` ∈ [0, 1] |
| **Regressor** | Next-day log-return magnitude | RMSE | `pred_log_return` |

**Signal generation:**

- `BUY` — `prob_up > 0.55`
- `SELL` — `prob_up < 0.45`
- `HOLD` — otherwise

**Target price:** `current_price × exp(pred_log_return)`

---

## Data Sources

- **Provider:** [SimFin](https://simfin.com/) — free-tier API (daily prices + quarterly fundamentals)
- **Coverage:** 5 years of historical data
- **Tickers:** AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA
